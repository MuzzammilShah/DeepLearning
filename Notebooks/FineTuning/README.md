### Hey There! (Again) 

**Note:**

These are the excercise materials provided in the course. My main purpose was to understand the practical application/process of performaaing fine-tuning so that I can apply this in my work. So I have just directly downloaded the materials which I felt were fairly simpler for me and have also added my notes ('Note for me') in the notebooks so that I understand some points a lot better. Other excersices I have done and implemented to test it for myself.

[Have named the file so that it's easier to navigate from there itself rather than coming back to this README file. I did that for the previous course that I was learning haha]
